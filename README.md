This project presents the basic implementation of a graph in c. It also contains an implementation of a heap that is used for Djistra's algorithm.
This is a University Homework Project that required critical thinking skills to be able to recognize the type of algorithms needed to solve this problem
and the tehnical skills necessary to implement it in c, while being careful with the memory manangment problems by allocating memory.
